# Blockchain Website Template

A pixel-perfect implementation of a blockchain website template, developed with modern web technologies and responsive design principles.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

-   Astro - Modern all-in-one web framework
-   TypeScript - For type safety and better development experience
-   Tailwind CSS - For utility-first styling
-   Framer Motion - For smooth animations and transitions

## 📱 Responsive Design

The website is carefully crafted to be responsive across three main breakpoints:

-   Mobile
-   Tablet
-   Desktop

Custom width values have been implemented to demonstrate advanced customization capabilities and precise design adherence.

## 🎯 Key Features

-   Pixel-perfect implementation of the design template
-   Dark theme optimized for blockchain aesthetic
-   Smooth animations and transitions
-   Fully responsive layout with custom breakpoints
-   TypeScript integration for enhanced code reliability
-   Modern and clean code architecture

## 🛠️ How to Use This Project for Learning

1. Clone the repository
2. Install VS Code with the Git Graph extension
3. Reference the design screens in the `screens` directory for each device size
4. Follow the commit history step by step using Git Graph
    - Each commit represents a specific implementation stage
    - Commits are organized to show the progressive development
    - Learn how to approach pixel-perfect development methodically
